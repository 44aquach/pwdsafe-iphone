# PasswordSafes for the iPhone 
PasswordSafes is an iPhone/iPod wrapper around the PasswordSafe open-source code. The app is available for 
free on the Apple AppStore under the name PasswordSafes, or 
here: http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/passwordsafes/id397686739?mt=8&ls=1

No adds, no restricted features, really free.

## Sourceforge
This project has been migrated from https://sourceforge.net/projects/pwdsafe-iphone/. Same owner/maintainer, I just
like git and github better.

## Building the code
